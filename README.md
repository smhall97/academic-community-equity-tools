# Academic Community Equity Tools
Academic research and related events have long been seen as inaccessible and not designed to accommodate a diverse audience with varying needs. These events are crucial for career advancement, research sharing, and networking. However, their inaccessibility negatively impacts careers of participants who cannot attend. Thus, it is essential for the event organisers to address this inequality from early stages of planning. There are successful efforts made to improve fairness and diversity, including ensuring disabled people can attend, using virtual event options and communicating in inclusive ways. More work can be done to assist historically underrepresented communities to access the academic events.

We present tools that can be used to critically assess and successfully implement actionable change within the organising of academic events. 

1. [The Academic Community Equity Index](https://github.com/smhall97/academic-community-equity-tools/blob/main/Academic%20Community%20Equity%20Index.xlsx)
: This benchmark is proposed as a starting point for the auditing of academic events. This tool can be used by organisers as a way of self-audit and making decision-making more transparent. This tool can also be used by participants as well as a way to score academic events to determine if they feel supported enough to attend. It is a simple binary scoring system, and the higher the score, the better the academic scores in terms of its commitment to inclusivity. 

2. [Action Plan](https://github.com/smhall97/academic-community-equity-tools/blob/main/action_plan.md): The action plan details stepas that can be taken to put the Rules into action. Please adapt the content and/or design/format of this sheet to suit your needs.

3. [Pre-event Questionnaire](https://github.com/smhall97/academic-community-equity-tools/blob/main/preevent_questionnaire.md): This is an example of a pre-event questionnaire that can be shared with participants. These questions can be adapted for the purpose of different events. The Pre-event questionnaire should be shared with attendees who are likely to attend, and those that indicate they cannot attend anymore.

Critical assessment of event planning is extremely important to ensure that as many people as possible get to benefit from academic events. To aid with that, supplementary resources were created including Action Plan with suggested actions to be undertaken Benchmark that can help to both self-assess and assess the events of other organisers.Â 

These tools are the work of ongoing development and we welcome suggestions in the way of GitHub Issues and Pull Requests.
