# Academic Community Equity Tools
Academic research and related events have long been seen as inaccessible and not designed to accommodate a diverse audience with varying needs. These events are crucial for career advancement, research sharing, and networking. However, their inaccessibility negatively impacts careers of participants who cannot attend. Thus, it is essential for the event organisers to address this inequality from early stages of planning. There are successful efforts made to improve fairness and diversity, including ensuring disabled people can attend, using virtual event options and communicating in inclusive ways. More work can be done to assist historically underrepresented communities to access the academic events.

We present tools that can be used to critically assess and successfully implement actionable change within the organising of academic events.

Critical assessment of event planning is extremely important to ensure that as many people as possible get to benefit from academic events. To aid with that, supplementary resources were created including Action Plan with suggested actions to be undertaken Benchmark that can help to both self-assess and assess the events of other organisers.Â
