These events are crucial for career advancement, research sharing, and networking, but their inaccessibility negatively impacts careers of participants who cannot attend. Thus, it is essential for the event organisers to address this inequality from early stages of planning. There are successful efforts made to improve fairness and diversity, including ensuring disabled people can attend, using virtual event options and communicating in inclusive ways. However, more work can be done to assist historically underrepresented communities to access the academic events. Here, we suggest a list of rules for making academic events more inclusive, presented as topics for consideration during planning stages.

 
**Rule 1.** Reach out, support and engage the communities that you do not often see at your events.

 
**Rule 2.** Carefully consider the location chosen for the event and what restrictions it imposes on people in terms of getting to and safely staying at the location.


**Rule 3.** Know of and provide any support necessary for participants to enter the country without excessive costs and stress.

 
**Rule 4.** Make ethical and sustainable decisions regarding people who help during conferences, from suppliers to staff.


**Rule 5.** Do not use virtual or hybrid event options as a substitution for greater inclusivity at in-person events and address the digital exclusion it creates.


**Rule 6.** Ensure social events are actively engaging and include variety of activity options for people with different needs and tolerances.&#x20;


**Rule 7.** When developing a programme, ask the attendees for their contribution to minimise conflicts and intensely packed schedules.
Thirdly, it is important to consistently create inclusive culture and ensure this can be sustained for many years.


 **Rule 8.** Have a fair, clear, and enforceable rules with regards to irresponsible and disruptive behaviour which are consistently applied and easy to access for attendees.


 **Rule 9.** Consistently raise funds for improving inclusion at the future events and advertise participants’ own funding campaigns so they can access a larger group of people.


 **Rule 10.** Bring it together by consistent self-assessment and the openness with which any criticism or relevant changes are undertaken.


Critical assessment of event planning is extremely important to ensure that as many people as possible get to benefit from academic events. To aid with that, supplementary resources were created including Action Plan with suggested actions to be undertaken, Resources List collating all useful resources used or encountered and Benchmark that can help to both self-assess and assess the events of other organisers.
