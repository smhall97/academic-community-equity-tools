# Academic Event Inclusivity Index
This benchmark is proposed as a starting point for the auditing of academic events. This tool can be used by organisers as a way of self-audit and making decision-making more transparent. This tool can also be used by participants as well as a way to score academic events to determine if they feel supported enough to attend. It is a simple binary scoring system, and the higher the score, the better the academic scores in terms of its commitment to inclusivity.

This benchmark is a work of ongoing development and we welcome suggestions and contributions. We welcome pull requests with suggested edits, and/or the provision of feedback via GitHub issues. 

As a practical tip, we propose the benchmark be used as agenda items in planning meetings, and the engaged with in a means of self-audit and a commitment to transparency in practices and development. Research performance evaluation and assessment framework should be evolved to recognise and reward academic or research roles who place greater emphasis and value on initiatives pushing boundaries of inclusion. These transparent feedback mechanisms need to include consultation with community leaders and stakeholders to ensure these inclusive practices increase over time.

Participants are also encouraged to use the benchmark to score events, to decide if the event is suitable for them to attend, and/or as a means to provide constructive feedback to organisers.
