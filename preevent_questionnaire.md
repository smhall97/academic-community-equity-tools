This is an example of a pre-event questionnaire that can be shared with participants. These questions can be adapted for the purpose of different events. The Pre-event questionnaire should be shared with attendees who are likely to attend, and those that indicate they cannot attend anymore. Please adapt the questionnaire to suit your needs and clearly indicate the options that are possible, and which are to support future planning efforts. Phrases such as the following can be used: “If the following were to be offered, would you be more likely to attend?”

**This questionnaire is not intended to be used as a survey to understand the demographics of attendees and experiences during the conference, but rather solely focus on ensuring inclusivity in event planning.**&#x20;
